        I'm a Computer Science student from India, focused on{" "}
        <strong>backend development, APIs, and ML</strong>. I enjoy taking
        projects from idea to working prototypes and learning by actually
        shipping code, not just reading theory.

      <p className="section-text">
        Recently, I've worked on a <strong>college community app</strong> as
        part of a tech society trainee team, and on a{" "}
        <strong>social feed + chatbot web app</strong> using React and a Python
        backend. I'm currently strengthening my{" "}
        <strong>Node.js and system design</strong> skills, aiming towards
        open-source contributions and programs like GSoC.
